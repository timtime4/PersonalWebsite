      <h1> Course Work</h1>
      <p> Below are some of the computer science and engineering related classes that I&#39;ve taken during my time at Notre Dame. Check out the descriptions to see what I&#39;ve learned about&#33;</p>
      
      <h2> Fundamentals of Computing I &#40;Fall 2013&#41;</h2>
      
      <p>This is the first part of a two-course introduction-to-computing sequence, intended primarily for computer science and computer engineering majors. It introduces fundamental concepts and principles of computer science, from formulating a problem and analyzing it conceptually, to designing, implementing, and testing a program on a computer. Using data and procedural abstractions as basic design principles for programs, students learn to define basic data structures, such as lists and trees, and to apply various algorithms for operating on them. The course also introduces object-oriented and parallel programming methods. </p>
      
      <h2> Fundamentals of Computing II &#40;Spring 2014&#41;</h2>
      
      <p>This is the second part of a two-course introduction-to-computing sequence, intended primarily for computer science and computer engineering majors. This course introduces concepts and techniques for developing large software systems. The object-oriented model of design and programming is presented using a modern programming language such as Java or C++. Topics covered include modularity, specification, data abstraction, classes and objects, genericness, inheritance, subtyping, design patterns, testing, concurrency, object persistency, and databases. </p>
      
      <h2> Discrete Mathematics &#40;Fall 2013&#41;</h2>
      
      <p>Introduction to mathematical techniques fundamental to computer engineering and computer science. Topics: mathematical logic, induction, set theory, relations, functions, recursion, recurrence relations, introduction to asymptotic analysis, algebraic structures, graphs, and machine computation. </p>
      
      <h2> Data Structures &#40;Fall 2014&#41;</h2>
      
      <p>Fundamental techniques in the design and analysis of non-numerical algorithms and their data structures. Elementary data structures such as lists, stacks, queues; more advanced ones such as priority queues and search trees. Design techniques such as divide-and-conquer. Sorting and searching and graph algorithms. </p>
      
      <h2> Logic Design &#40;Spring 2014&#41;</h2>
      
      <p>Boolean algebra and switching circuits, Karnaugh maps, design of combinational and of sequential logic networks, and sequential machines. </p>
      
      <h2> Computer Architecture &#40;Fall 2014&#41;</h2>
      
      <p>Introduction to basic architectural concepts that are present in current scalar machines, together with an introduction to assembly language programming, computer arithmetic, and performance evaluation. Commercial computer-aided-design software is used to deepen the student's understanding of the top-down processor design methodology. MIPS-based assembly language will be used. </p>
      
      <h2> Operating Systems Principles &#40;Spring 2015&#41;</h2>
      
      <p>Introduction to all aspects of modern operating systems. Topics include process structure and synchronization, interprocess communication, memory management, file systems, security, I/O, and distributed files systems. </p>
      
      <h2> Basic Unix for Engineers &#40;Spring 2014&#41;</h2>
      
      <p>This course covers basic Unix/Linux, as well as make files, shell scripting, etc. </p>
      
      <h2> Integrated Engineering and Business &#40;Fall 2013&#41;</h2>
      
      <p>The course is designed to improve the effectiveness of engineers working in corporations by teaching how and why businesses operate. Subjects covered include business financial reporting, business plans, the development processes, project management, the supply chain, and a history of quality topics. Numerous guest speakers are utilized to give the students exposure to successful business executives and reinforce the business processes covered in class</p>
      
      <h2> Programming Paradigms &#40;Spring 2015&#41;</h2>
      
      <p>Programming language overview: imperative and functional languages; logic programming. Scripting languages and tools. Development environments. Multilanguage interfacing. Case studies. Comprehensive programming practice using several languages. </p>
      
      <h2> Theory of Computing &#40;Spring 2015&#41;</h2>
      
      <p>The theory of automata and formal languages is developed along with applications. Various classes of automata, formal languages, and the relations between these classes are studied. Restricted models of computation; finite automata and pushdown automata; grammars and their relations to automata; parsing; turing machines; limits of computation: undecidable problems, the classes of P and NP. </p>
      
      <h2> Introduction to Digital Forensics &#40;Spring 2015&#41;</h2>
      
      <p>This course will provide students with an introduction to digital forensic science and the systematic process of acquiring, authenticating and analyzing digital evidence. We will concentrate on understanding how computer technology creates electronic evidence and how it is stored. Technical and managerial topics will be explored, providing students with both theoretical and practical experience using forensic hardware and software. Students will learn about and use forensics software/tool kits to analyze and recover potential evidence in file systems, memory, registry, networks, browsers, email, and mobile devices. Upon completion of this course, students are expected to be well trained as next-generation computer crime investigators and be prepared for active research at the forefront in the areas studied. </p>
